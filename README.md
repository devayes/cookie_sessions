Cookie Sessions
===============

##### Purpose:
Use cookies to store session data. Highly scalable (no DB reads/writes) & stateless.

##### Recommendations:
- It's recommended to encrypt cookie data to prevent tampering. 
- Cookies have size limitations, domain limitations, etc. Make sure you [understand these limits](http://browsercookielimits.x64.me/).

##### Examples:
Example included. Upload the contents of the repo and load index.php in your browser.
 
##### Notes:
This is pretty old (2010), just thought I'd share it.
